Results:
- Program output with correctness check can be found in output.png
- Execution time measurements were done on a vector with the same value

* 2^20
  * C:          0.002233 s
  * Assembly:   0.001600 s
* 2^24
  * C:          0.036733 s
  * Assembly:   0.026133 s
* 2^28
  * C:          0.583333 s
  * Assembly:   0.407067 s

Analysis:

Assembly is faster by a bit compared to C
Our results showed 28.39%, 28.86%, and 30.22% reduction in execution time for 2^20, 2^24, and 2^28 respectively
This is because...
